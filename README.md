# UniProt-Or-Mapping
An *object relational* mapping of **UniProtKB** to a database (and Java objects) using Hibernate.

## Auto-generate Java code and a relational database to manage UniProt data.

This projects uses the [UniProt XML schema](http://www.uniprot.org/docs/uniprot.xsd) to auto-generate Java code as well as a relational database mapping.

## Populate the database and load UniProt data.

Once the initial code/database have been created any UniProt-XML file can get parsed and loaded into the database.

## Default: Load all of SWISSPROT

The default functionality provided here is to load all SWISSPROT entries into the database (see the ``LoadMissing.java`` class).
Currently these includes about 550k UniProt entries. The process to load all these files takes about 8 hours on a typical database server.


## Get Started

  1. Check out the code
  2. Make sure you have access to a MySQL installation, create an empty new database there, make sure you have write permissions
  3. Update the configuration in ```src/main/resources/database.properties``` to match your configuration
  4. Run ```LoadMissing.java``` (ideally over-night, by next morning you will have a populated database)

Alternative, if you compile the code with ```mvn package```, you will get an executable jar file. You can run this jar file and pass in the DB configuration as a command line parameter (see ```LoadMissing.java``` as the main class).   

## Still TODO

  Release on Maven Central
